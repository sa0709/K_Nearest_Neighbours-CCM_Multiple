# Comparable Company Multiples using K-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview

A machine learning approach to calculate the multiple for the subject company using KNN regression on financial metrics of comparable companies.

## Features

Uses the multi-dimensional financial data of the companies covering 35+ metrices overs 5 years and risk adjustment framework.

## Input Structure

Documents all required Excel sheets including Financial_Data, Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Factors, and Instructions sheets with their specific purposes.

## Risk Framework

Explains the seven risk factors (Key Managerial Personnel, Geographical Presence, Customer/Vendor/Product Concentration, Litigation, Environmental Impact) and their rating system.

## Technical Implementation:

- Installation instructions with required packages
- Usage guide for running the analysis
- File structure documentation
- Dependencies list (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, etc.)

## Methodology Section 

Breaks down the four-step process:
1. Data preprocessing with standardization
2. KNN model training with distance weighting
3. Prediction and risk adjustment
4. Statistical analysis and benchmarking
